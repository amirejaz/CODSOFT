- Interact with an AI-powered chatbot through a user-friendly graphical interface. Explore features such as web searches, YouTube video lookup, music playback, and engaging conversations. Built using Python and libraries like tkinter, webbrowser, PIL, and pywhatkit.


# TASK 02:- TIC-TAC-TOE AI:
- Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

### SOLUTION tictactoe.py | tictactoeHome.py
- Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Tkinter GUI and AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. Play against the AI or with a friend. The AI calculates optimal moves to ensure challenging gameplay
- tictactoe.py file contains all the code for game implementation.
- tictactoeHome.py file contains the home page of a game that you see after running the file that will show you the play and exit buttons.
